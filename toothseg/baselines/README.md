# Baseline implementations of tooth segmentation in cone-beam CT scans

This is the code repository providing implementations of four baseline methods for multi-class tooth instance segmentation in cone-beam CT scans, which we call [ReluNet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571221002888), [CuiNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29637-2),  [WangNet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523000117), and [LiuNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-024-00294-z).

## Framework

The baselines are implemented with PyTorch Lightning to allow for easy use of multiple GPUs for fast training and inference.

Each baseline comes with its own configuration file (`baselines/config`), train script (`baselines/train`) and inference script (`baselines/infer`). For inference using the below provided model checkpoints, or for re-training on your own dataset, these files should be sufficient for most purposes.


## Installation

```bash
conda create -n baselines python=3.9
conda activate baselines

pip3 install torch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 torchaudio==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Inference

### Model Checkpoints

The checkpoints for all baseline methods, trained on the ToothFairy2 Challenge Dataset can be found here:
https://zenodo.org/records/14893540

To use the checkpoints, please download and unzip the archive in the current working directory.
Then, you can specify the paths to each checkpoint of a method in the method's configuration file in `baselines/config` after the `pretrained` key.


### Configuration

You can specify your settings in the configuration file. Starting under 'datamodule', the settings below specify which scans you would like to include:

- *root*: The absolute path to your data root directory.
- *scan_dir*: The path relative to root with the scans.
- *regex_filter*: Filter the scans and segmentations using a regular expression.
- *exclude*: Filter the scans and segmentations using a list of excluded file prefixes.

The code expects to find files with the `.nii.gz` suffix in your specified scan directory and the code will save the predictions using the same file name as the scan. More settings can be configured under 'model':

- *return_type*: Whether to return FDI numbering (11-48) or ISO numbering (1-32).
- *pretrained*: Specify the path to a model checkpoint relative to the current working directory.

### Running inference

Once you have configured your settings, inference can be started using a script in the `baselines/infer` folder. Here, you should specify the final stage if possible and the number of GPUs with `--devices`. Inference will save the predictions in a folder within the root directory specified before.


## Training

### Configuration

Additional settings can be configured for training under `datamodule`:

- *seg_dir*: The path relative to root with the segmentations.
- *val_size*: The proportion of scans used for validation.
- *include_val_as_train*: Whether to include the validation scans for training to train a model on all available data.
- *test_size*: The proportion of scans used for hold-out testing.

Furthermore, each stage of a baseline has their own settings:

- *regular_spacing*: The isotropic spacing in millimeters to resample the scans, `null` means the scans are not resampled to isotropic spacing.
- *instances_dir*: The path relative to root with the instance predictions used for training the final single tooth stage for the first three baselines.
- *crop_size*: The crop size in voxels to crop the teeth ROI.
- *patch_size*: The patch size in voxels to crop around a single tooth.
- *pre_transform*: Extra transformations to perform before caching.
- *aug_transform*: Data augmentations to perform on the train data.
- *transform*: Transformations to perform after loading cached data and data augmentations.

### Running training

Once you have configured your settings, training can be started using a script in the `baselines/train` folder. Here, you can specify the stage you would like to train and the number of GPUs with `--devices`. Furthermore, you can resume a stopped training run by specifying a model checkpoint using the `--checkpoint` console argument. The data will be preprocessed during the first epoch and cached to a folder in the root directory you specified. This preprocessing can take a very long time.

All stages except the final stage can be run just from a script in `baselines/train`. However, training of the final stage depends on the predictions from the prior stages. As such, after training the prior stages, the predictions need to be determined using a script in `baselines/infer` by choosing the prior stage. These predictions will be saved to a folder within the root directory you specified. Afterward, you can select the final stage in the script in the `baselines/train` folder to continue training the final stage.
